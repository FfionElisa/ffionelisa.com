title: About
---
I am a Welsh illustrator living and working in the foothills of Snowdonia, Wales, UK.

I have a love of decorative surfaces, patterns and colours coming from a background in textiles and print design. I would describe my style as fun, child friendly and with almost always a sense of and or narrative.

When I'm not illustrating I'm usually found hiking in the North Wales countryside, planning my next trip abroad, singing, or baking.

Chances are, I would love to work with you so if you have an idea you would like to bring to life feel free to get in touch.
